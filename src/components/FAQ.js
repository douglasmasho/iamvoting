                            This section answers questions about the fundamentals of what SEE Namibia can and cannot. 
                            It describes the different kinds of campaigning and political activity that exist, and how
                             the organisation will approach the possibility of undertaking campaigning work. It also describes 
                             the limits that the organisation has, fundamentally that all campaigning and political activity must 
                             further or support charitable purposes, and that such activity must never be for a political party.

                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">Yes – SEE Namibia can become involved in campaigning and in political activity which further or support its charitable purposes, as its governing document allows it. <br /><br />
                            In more detail Engagement in campaigning is a means by which the organisation works to further its purposes, as it also engages in political activity in support of those purposes. So long as the organisation is engaging in campaigning 
                            or political activity solely in order to further or support its civic purposes, and there is a reasonable likelihood of it being effective, it may carry out campaigning and political activity, as set out in this guidance. The activities
                             it undertakes must be a legitimate and reasonable way for the members to further those purposes, and must never be party political. An organisation will make public comment on social, economic and political issues if these relate to its purpose,
                              or the way in which the organisation is able to carry out its work. These principles lie behind the bylaws of SEE Namibia. Whilst there is no limit on the extent to which the organisation can engage in campaigning in furtherance of its civic purposes,
                               political activity can only be a means of supporting or contributing to the achievement of those purposes, although it may be a significant contribution. Hence, political activity will not be the only way in which the organisation pursues its charitable purposes.

                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">No – Founding members have discretion to decide how best to use the resources of the
                             organisation to achieve its purposes. Affiliate members are not required to campaign, nor should they feel under external pressure to do so.  <br /><br />
                            Whilst the organisation will not have to campaign, affiliate members should consider the best way of achieving civic engagement purposes, and
                             as part of this consideration will be the level of scrutiny that comes with participating in political party campaigning. Believe of taking 
                             part in civic engagement should only be in the interests of the organisation’s affiliate members to do so, members will also be entitled to engage 
                             in political party activity. However, they are not under any obligation to engage in such activity. As these activities will be a highly effective
                              means of pursuing for the organisation’s purpose, even where the matters at issue are controversial. The organisation has a vital role to play in society
                               in promoting the interests of social beneficiaries and in contributing to public debate. The direct experience of these beneficiaries’ needs as they are often uniquely

                                some purposes (such as the promotion of human rights) which are more likely than others to lead affiliate members to want to engage in campaigning and political activity.  <br /><br />
                                However, political activity can be carried out by the organisation to support the delivery of its purposes. Political activity: political activity, must only be undertaken by the organisation

                                policy or decisions of central government, Local Authorities or other public bodies, whether in this country or abroad are referred to as political purpose. This differs from activity aimed at ensuring

                            activity as this could call into question the propriety of their actions, or ultimately, SEE Namibia’s status. The organisation can seek to influence central or local government or public opinion issues relating to the purposes 
                            of the organisation. SEE Namibia may also speak out on issues of relevance to the wider well-being of the nonprofit sector. These principles apply both to consideration of new and of existing public policy. They also apply at a 
                            national, regional and local level. Supporting existing legislation: the organisation can engage in campaigning activity which aims to ensure that existing laws are observed. Just as opposing a government policy may further the

                        SEE Namibia may often wish to influence political decision-makers. Although charities cannot give their support to a political party, there are 
                        many ways in which they can lawfully work in the political arena.

                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">No – SEE Namibia must not give its support to any one political party. It may express support for 
                            particular policies which will contribute to the delivery of its own purposes so long as its independence is maintained, and perceptions of its 
                            independence are not adversely affected.

                            to a specific policy which is advocated by a political party.SEE Namibia cannot give general support to a political party, because all political parties have a range of policies. So if the 
                            organisation endorses a party because it agrees with one policy (say on development), it is effectively supporting the party as a whole and will be endorsing the party’s wider policies 
                            (say on taxation, education, defense etc.), which have nothing to do with the SEE Namibia’s purposes. Whilst support for a specific policy may be an important way of contributing to the organisation’s purposes, 
                            support for a political party even when it advocates a policy that the organisation supports, is not open and becomes a partisan. SEE Namibia cannot give financial support, or support in kind, to a political party.

                            also advocates, the organisation will stress and make clear its independence, both to its affiliate members and to those people whose views it is seeking to influence.  <br /><br /> Example: an executive Director of the organisation,
                             in that capacity, signs a letter to a newspaper advocating support for a political candidate. This would clearly be party political activity and, as such, is not permitted activity.

                            In doing so, they must remain politically neutral and should consider working with other parties to help ensure public perceptions of neutrality. SEE 
                            Namibia can invite a politician to speak in support of its aims, for example at a reception to launch a national campaign, or at a AM. Whilst ideally 
                            the organisation enlisting the support of politicians it should, for reasons of independence and neutrality, seek cross party representation, 
                            some forms of campaign methods might make this impractical.

                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text "> <b className="deep-blue-text">The need for neutrality:</b> Due consideration should be given by SEE Namibia to ensuring that the methods chosen for delivering a campaign are part of a well thought through strategy and do not inadvertently result in any form of partisan support.

The organisation will consider the impact of the range and scope of the views, and how they are expressed, on its overall work. As part of this consideration the founding members should assess whether the views expressed represent any risks to the organisation’s reputation.

                        This section is focused on the management of the organisation, and the issues they should consider before embarking on campaigning or political activity. Although 
                        campaigning is a legitimate activity for the organisation and the considerations that apply are similar to those for any other activity: management should be confident
                         that the options, risks, costs and benefits have been carefully weighed up before starting a campaign.

                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text "> As with any activity, campaigning and political activity will carry some
                             opportunities and risks which the committee will need to identify and plan to manage. Management must be satisfied on reasonable
                              grounds that the activities are likely be an effective means of furthering or supporting the purposes of the organisation; and are 
                              able to justify the resources applied. There are a range of ways which management should consider using to satisfy themselves of this,
                               and to demonstrate that they have done so; for example, by keeping a risk register, a strategic plan, and minute keeping of meetings
                                where such issues have been considered. The nature of campaigning, and the changing nature of the environment within which it takes
                                 place, means that it is an area of activity where new and innovative approaches are often developed. Within the framework of this guidance. 
                                 It is important that the risks are identified and managed; it is also important that management is not overly cautious or risk averse. <br /><br />  
                                <b className="deep-blue-text">Agreeing objectives:</b> when planning or considering a campaign or political activity, management need to be clear about 
                                how the campaign or activity  will further or support the work of the organisation and, with that in mind, set clear and measurable objectives. 
                                A political activity might be highly successful in achieving the objective of raising public awareness, or of encouraging the public to support the
                                 work of the organisation, even if it does not lead to an immediate change of law or government policy. Not all political activity will be successful. 
                                 It is therefore important for management to be able to explain their decision to engage in campaigning or political activity, and to set objectives for
                                  the campaign which have a reasonable likelihood of success, as well as making sure that they have monitored progress towards them during the implementation
                                phase of the campaign. <br /><br /> <b className="deep-blue-text">Evaluating and managing risks:</b> the committee is responsible for identifying and reviewing the major risks to which the organisation is exposed, and for putting in place systems to mitigate these risks. Some types of campaigning and political activity, particularly those that have a high public profile, have the potential both to enhance and to damage the reputation of SEE Namibia, and also to compromise its independence. This means that the organisation need to identify and manage the possible risks involved; it does not mean that they have to avoid all risks. <br /><br />

                                <li>the risk that the activity may not be effective, or that SEE Namibia will be drawn into activities that are outside its purposes  </li>
                                <li>the costs and benefits of engaging in a particular campaign  </li>
                                <li>ways of approaching the campaign</li>
                                <li>the risks attached to the campaign, and how these might best be managed; these include public perceptions of the organisation’s independence, for example if a charity is supporting or opposing a policy that is also advocated by a political party</li>
                                <li>the strategy for delivering the campaign</li>
                                <li>•	how best to evaluate the campaign’s success and impact management must not allow the organisation to be used as a vehicle for the expression of the political views of any individual or member. Management should also ensure that they have an adequate level of knowledge about their donors. The committee should be alert to the risk that, very occasionally, a donor may have an ulterior motive for giving money to the organisation that could be unconnected with the work of SEE Namibia, and which could adversely affect the organisation’s reputation. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of management   to be satisfied that a donation is in the best interests of the organisation. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">Reputational risk- management will also need to consider the impact of the proposed campaigning or political activity for the ’s reputation. The organisation’s independence and reputation must be protected, and management will need, as part of their overall campaign strategy, to consider arrangements to protect the organisation’s reputation. Balance of risks and benefits: overall, the committee need to be reasonably convinced that the likely benefits of campaigning outweigh the costs and risks. That involves assessing the likelihood of a successful outcome. The management must ask themselves:  </p>
                            <ul className="normal-text  u-padding u-margin-top" style={{paddingTop: "0px"}}>
                                <li>Will this really further or support the work of the organisation?  </li>
                                <li>Is it worth the effort and resources involved? </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text "> If they can answer yes to both questions, they can confidently go ahead. Monitoring impact and success: monitoring and evaluating the success of a campaign should be built into a campaign strategy from the outset. They are a key means of ensuring that resources are being used wisely, and of contributing to the effectiveness of future campaigns.  </p>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text "> <b className="deep-blue-text">Consultation:</b> in seeking to influence legislation or public policy SEE Namibia may consider consulting with its key stakeholders, and possibly with members of the public. It might, for example, arrange consultative meetings in order to test the views of its beneficiaries before supporting changes to legislation and public policy. Such consultation is not, however, a formal requirement. The main consideration for management is that they have a clear understanding of the ways in which the activity will further or support the work of the organisation. <br /><br />
                            Where a political activity or linked campaign does not have a realistic end date, it has the potential to be viewed as a political purpose, and could call into question the propriety of the activity, or ultimately the status of the SEE Namibia. The key decision for management is whether the political activity supports the organisation’s purpose to an extent that justifies the resources used. Committee knowledge of the organisation means that they are well placed to decide whether a particular activity is likely to be an effective way of supporting SEE Namibia’s purposes. As well as making an informed decision, 
                            management must be able to explain the reasoning behind it. They also need to be able to counter any criticisms that may arise - for instance that the change in the law which they sought to influence was too remote a possibility to have been achieved, or that the committee were pursuing an agenda linked, or perceived to be linked, to their personal political views. Management must always have regard to their responsibility to use charitable funds and assets wisely, and only in furtherance or support of SEE Namibia.

                            <h3 className="sub-header-text  u-margin-bottom-small">4.1 What methods can SEE Namibia use to campaign?</h3>
                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">the organisation use any reasonable method to campaign, so long as it is lawful, and an effective use of its resources. 
                            There are many forms of activity that SEE Namibia will use to deliver campaigns, and these are changing and developing all the time. This section covers some of the issues 
                            that the organisation should consider, and provides guidance on some of the methods used.   
                            <br /><br />
                             Use of campaign materials: irrespective of whether the organisation is engaging the support of the general public, or of a local community, it is free to use whatever lawful
                             method of communication it believes to be appropriate to its campaign.  <br /><br />
                                <b className="deep-blue-text">SEE Namibia’s position:</b> sometimes the organisation will choose to set out a full explanation of its position and reasons for the campaign, in order to gain support for it. There is no specific legal or regulatory requirement for the full position to be set out in all campaign materials. Many forms of communication used for campaigning work, for example a newspaper advertisement limited by its size, or a restricted time slot on television or radio, will make it impractical to do so.  <br /><br />
                                <b className="deep-blue-text">New technologies:</b> new and innovative techniques for effective campaigning are developing all the time. For example, internet campaigns are now commonplace and the use of mobile phone text messaging facilities is an increasingly popular means of engaging the support of campaigners. In this fast-changing environment, the organisation seek specialist advice if they are in any doubt about the legality, propriety or indeed cost-effectiveness, of their proposed campaign or activity. <br /><br />  
                                <b className="deep-blue-text">Mobilizing support:</b> the organisation should provide its supporters, or members of the public, with material to send to Members of the national assembly, national council, councilors, central government, or the local authority, provided that, if requested, it can justify and demonstrate that a considered decision was made to engage in the activity and there is a rationale for using the chosen material.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 className="sub-header-text  u-margin-bottom-small">4.2 Should the organisation carry out research to back up a campaign? </h3>
                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">organisation can choose to use research to support and strengthen a campaign or political activity, although there is no requirement to do so. The key point is that any claims made in support of a campaign should be well founded. SEE Namibia may use their resources to carry out a research, so long as the management assure themselves of its quality and validity. As part of their campaigning and political activity the organisation sometimes can use research in order to inform and educate the public, or to support and inform a policy position and add weight to any influencing activities. The type of research used varies according to the nature of a campaign, for example, whether the research is to support an education and awareness-raising campaign, or to back up and add weight to a campaign to change law or policy. <br /><br />
                            In carrying out research, or endorsing research carried out by other organisations, SEE Namibia should ensure that the research is properly conducted using robust and objective research methods. For some campaigns management might choose to commission independent research - say from an academic institution or a research company - to ensure that the figures and statistics they use in a campaign are verified, and therefore also perceived to be objective. There is no requirement to commission independent research, or to use research to support a campaign, and many smaller charities do not have the resources to do so. The key point for the organisation is the need for any campaign to be well founded and effective, and sometimes the use of research will be the best way of ensuring this.

                            <h3 className="sub-header-text  u-margin-bottom-small">4.3 Can SEE Namibia work with other organisations on a campaign?  </h3>
                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">The organisation may work with other organisations to further or support its own charitable purposes. There are certain risks to this, and management need to be aware of the risks and manage them. <br /><br />
                            Lobbying coalitions: it is open for SEE Namibia to form coalitions, alliances and consortia for the purpose of lobbying MPs and government for changes to the law. It is not realistic to expect that everything that a campaigning alliance does, particularly if it has a large membership, will fit with every one of its members’ purposes and there are, therefore, some important considerations. <br /><br />
                            Factors to consider: an organisation wishing to participate in such an alliance should consider whether:  
                            </p>
                            <ul className="normal-text  u-padding u-margin-top" style={{paddingTop: "0px"}}>
                                <li>there is a reasonable expectation that the arrangement will help to further or support of both organisation’s purposes.</li>
                                <li>any expenditure can be justified as being an effective use of resources</li>
                                <li>the risks of participating are outweighed by the benefits; in particular, if some of the political activity that an alliance may engage in does not fit with SEE Namibia purposes, the organisation will need to consider how best to manage any risks to its reputation, and its work it may also need to consider whether to withdraw, at least temporarily, from the alliance unless there is some way of isolating the charity from those activities </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h3 className="sub-header-text  u-margin-bottom-small">4.4 Can SEE Namibia organize demonstrations?</h3>
                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">Yes – the organisation can in principle organize different kinds of direct action in support of campaign activities. There are legal requirements, and there might also be particular risks that management need to take into account in doing so. <br /><br />
                             As part of a campaign, the organisation may wish to organize, promote or participate in some kind of demonstration or direct action. This might involve simply the provision of information in a public place, such as handing out leaflets in order to raise awareness. Further considerations apply if SEE Namibia wishes to participate in an event and do more than just provide information. Such events might include participation in marches, rallies, or peaceful picketing. Such participation might offer significant opportunities for publicizing the organisation’s position on an issue, and further its purposes, or show the extent of public support for the issue.  <br /><br />
                             <b className="deep-blue-text">The risks:</b> Equally, the organisation will also need to balance these potential benefits against any possible risks from engaging in the event. For example, there will always be some people who regard any involvement by a nonprofit organisation in events of this kind as inappropriate. This view could pose risks for the reputation of the organisation. Therefore, at the outset it is important to assess the likelihood and scale of any risk of damaging public support for the organisation.  <br /><br />
                             <b className="deep-blue-text">Public order:</b> events such as demonstrations and rallies can also present real problems of control for the organisation, because of the complexities of public order legislation. The nature of public demonstrations means that there is a greater risk of an offence being committed by representatives of SEE Namibia, or others taking part, compared with other campaigning activities. For this reason, the organisation should consider carefully what steps it can take to minimize or mitigate the risk of these offences occurring, for example through careful preparation and good liaison with the police or other authorities.  <br /><br />
                             <b className="deep-blue-text">Working with other organisations:</b>   organisations taking part in events involving a number of organisations should consider and manage the risks of participating alongside organisations who do not share the aims of the event organizers. <br /><br />
                                SEE Namibia should also seek to ensure that any event is fully under control.

                            <p className=" normal-text justify-text ">Yes – the organisation may organize a petition in support of its charitable campaign activity. There are some legal and good practice requirements that management must consider before doing so. <br /><br />
 A charity may organize and present a petition to either to the national assembly, the national council or to any body of national or local government. The petition, or supporting material provided by the organisation, should make it clear what the purpose of the petition is, so that those individuals considering supporting it know what they are signing up to, management should also be able to demonstrate, on request, that the petition’s authenticity can be verified.
