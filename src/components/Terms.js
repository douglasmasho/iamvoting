                            <p className="white-text normal-text justify-text ">SEE NAMIBIA is a youth organization that is aimed at youth empowerment and advocating for the participation of youth in democratic processes. 
                            Africa is the youngest continent in the world with young people making up 60% of the population as such it is imperative that we capacitate these young people with the necessary leadership skills to be able to lead Africa into economic and social prosperity,
                             furthermore we must encourage young people to be active 
                            participants in democratic processes so that they can become agents of change. Hence the organization has created a formal platform, the Volunteering program, to encourage and enhance the participation of Namibian youth within democratic structures.

                                The Volunteering structure is aimed at encouraging young people to venture into volunteerism to create positive change within their communities and gain new skills and broaden their network while doing so. In its essence the volunteering program
                                 is the organization’s formal structure for volunteerism, to provide a platform for people to volunteer their time, skills, and energy in service of the community.

                            <p className="white-text normal-text justify-text ">Volunteering for the organization would be done in two ways to allow for a more robust form of volunteering and to give people options to choose from to maximize
                             their experiences as volunteers for the organization.
                            </p>

                            <p className="white-text normal-text justify-text">
                            The first form of volunteering is general volunteering where the volunteers would work in the various projects and programs the organization would be doing. This type of general volunteering would allow for the assimilation of volunteers into permanent
                             structures of the organization while gaining skills.
                            </p>

                            And the second form of volunteering is specific volunteering where volunteers are only involved in one of the organization’s five strategic objectives of their choice. The specific volunteering would allow for volunteers to gain specific skills in any area
                             of the strategic objectives or any of the projects, structures of the organization they have chosen. Furthermore, the specific form of volunteering would allow for the
                             organization to partner up with universities or organization to allow for students or any young person seeking for specific skills to intern with the organization for a period of time.
